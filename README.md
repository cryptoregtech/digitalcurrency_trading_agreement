Master Agreement for Digital Currency trades

Two parties may decide that their agreement to privately sell currencies including fiat/government backed currencies and digital currencies (Currencies) for other Currencies or other forms of Consideration is subject to these terms (the Master Agreement). If so, one party (the Offeror) will make an offer referring to the Master Agreement (an Order), which may be accepted by the other party (the Offeree). If that Order is accepted before it expires, the resulting contract between the parties (a Contract) shall be governed by this Master Agreement.


1) Orders

An Order shall describe the following:

1.1 when the Order expires;
1.1.1 the Currency to be sold;
1.1.2 the Consideration which will be acceptable to the seller;
1.1.3 the quantity of Currency on offer;
details of whether that Order can be accepted in part;
1.1.4 the price;
1.1.5 the time by which payment in respect of the Order must be made;
1.1.6 the methods of payment acceptable for the purpose of the Order;
1.1.7 the date and time at which the Order will expire.

1.2 An Order may also indicate whether:

1.2.1 an escrow service is to be used;
1.2.2 an arbitration service is to be used;
1.2.3 due diligence is requested;
1.2.4 any further terms apply to that Order, in which case those terms shall prevail over the terms of the Master Agreement.

2) Verification Services
2.1 Independent third party service - An Offeror may request the appointment of an independent third party service to assist with the verification of certain information provided by both parties. This may be to confirm that the parties’ identity through cryptographic means or other means. if there are particular fees for this service, the person or persons liable for the fees will be indicated in the Offer document. 

2.2 Self-Verification - The parties may request that certain Identification documentation to each other directly. The type of identification documents that are requested and the format of those documents will be listed in the Offer Document.

2.3 Transaction Verification - The Offeror may reserve the right for a time period indicated in the Offer schedule to verify that the Consideration paid by the Offeree (if by bank transfer) is from an account in the Offeree’s name. Alternatively the Offeror may recognise that the Digital Currency being received is not from a geographical area associated with the Offeree.

2.4 Source of funds - The Offeror may require proof of source of Consideration used to settle trade. 

2.5 The pre-Contract due diligence process should take no more than the time listed in the Offer Document. 

2.6 Any delay in supplying any information requested to complete the Verification process supplying the information required the other party in a timely manner, the affected party will give notice to rescind the Offer and it will be as if the Contract never took place. 


3) Trading process
	
There are three trading options. Standard trading, escrow or arbitration. 
	
3.1 Standard trade process

3.1.1 Following due diligence if applicable, each party shall pay, in accordance with the Settlement Method, and prior to the Settlement Deadline, the Currency/Consideration due to the other.
3.1.2 If no due diligence is required on a trade then in the event that the trade is not fulfilled both parties unreservedly agree to provide each other with contact details upon notice from one of the parties. 

Escrow trade process

The parties shall agree to pay the fees of the escrow agent. The escrow agent’s terms will be incorporated into this agreement. 
The parties shall each pay into the escrow account(s) specified in the Contract the Currency specified in that Contract, before the Settlement Deadline. 

Where a due diligence process has failed in respect of a particular Contract, that Contract shall immediately terminate and the Currency held in the escrow account(s) shall be returned to the parties which paid them, less any charges levied by the Escrow Provider(s) which shall be shared equally between the parties.

Otherwise, where no due diligence is involved or that the due diligence process has been successful, the parties shall each communicate to the Escrow Provider(s) that the obligations of the other have been fulfilled and request that their funds are released to that other party.

Arbitration Trading Process

The parties shall agree to pay the fees of the appointed arbiter. The terms stated by the arbiter shall be incorporated into this agreement.  

Where a due diligence process has failed in respect of a particular Contract, that Contract shall immediately terminate and any fees levied by the Arbiter shall be paid for by the party that failed the Verification Service.

Otherwise, where no due diligence is involved or where the due diligence has been successful, each party shall pay, in accordance with the Settlement Method, and prior to the Settlement Deadline, the Currency or Consideration due to the other.

In the event of a dispute between the parties the arbiter shall intervene to decide the outcome and their decision shall be full and final. 

Under no circumstances will the arbiter be held liable for any mistake made. This does not preclude the parties to the contract taking action against each other for breach of contract or non-performance.

Both parties will agree, in the Order form on an alternative arbiter in the event that the original arbiter is unreachable.


Warranties
	
	Each party to a Contract warrants to the other that:
	
it has the power to execute and perform its obligations under the Contract;
such execution and performance do not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents if it is a legal entity, any order or judgment of any court or regulatory body, or any contract to which it is a party;
it has obtained and complied with all licences, consents and permissions it requires to perform its obligations under the Contract and will use its reasonable endeavours to renew, maintain or add to them as necessary for the purposes of the Contract;
all information supplied by it to the other party is accurate and complete.

Default and Interest

Subject to clause 7 (Force Majeure), if one party to a Contract fails to make a payment due to an Escrow Agent or to the other party by the due time for payment, then, without limiting the other party’s remedies under this agreement, the party in default shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 5% per annum above the base rate of the Bank of England from time to time.  Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment.

Where interest is due under clause 4.1, the defaulting party to a Contract shall pay to the other party:

the interest; and
the overdue amount; and
if the other party suffers a loss in respect of the overdue amount as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates, a sum equal to that loss.

Where a party to a Contract is due an amount in respect of a loss suffered in accordance with clause 4.2.3 that loss shall be calculated by reference to the exchange rate between the two currencies as reported by Google Inc. on the relevant dates.

Time is of the essence for the purpose of a Contract.

Tax
	
All taxes are the responsibility of each party respectively. If VAT is due on a particular sale of DC then the transaction will be deemed to have included VAT and it will be the responsibility of the seller to report and pay the VAT due. 
All payments by a party under a Contract shall be made without withholding or deduction of, or in respect of, any Tax unless required by law.  If any such withholding or deduction is required, that party shall:

promptly notify the other party of that requirement;

pay the amount required to be withheld or deducted, including the amount to be deducted or withheld from any additional sum paid to the other party in accordance with this clause 5, and provide the other party with evidence of that payment;

when making the payment to which the withholding or deduction relates, pay to the receiving party such additional amount as will ensure that the receiving party receives the same total amount that it would have received if it had no such withholding or deduction had been required.


Limitation of Liability

Nothing in this Master Agreement shall limit or exclude a party’s liability:

for death or personal injury caused by its negligence;
for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;
for breach of any obligation as to title or quiet possession implied by statute; or
for any other act, omission, or liability which may not be limited or excluded by law.

Subject to clause 6.1, neither party to a Contract shall have any liability to the other party, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, for any loss of profit, or for any indirect or consequential loss arising under or in connection with the Contract.

Subject to clause 6.1 a party’s total liability to the other party to a Contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in connection with this agreement shall be limited to the sum of all Currency due to both parties under the Contract.

For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to clause 6.1, neither Diacle nor Roolo shall have any liability to any of the parties to a Contract unless they are themselves a party to that Contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise in connection with that Contract.

The time for performance of such obligations shall be extended accordingly.

A party may, provided that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party is involved in activity that may constitute a criminal offence under the Bribery Act 2010, disclose Confidential Information to the Serious Fraud Office without first informing the other party of such disclosure.

Each party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information. No rights or obligations in respect of a party's Confidential Information other than those expressly stated in this agreement are granted to the other party, or to be implied from this agreement.

This clause does not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action or, where applicable, any arbitration or other method of dispute resolution. 

Waiver

No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
